# TTS Cloud Sync

Sync a local folder with the Tabletop Simulator cloud.

Note: this tool is loosely based on [tts-cloud-manager](https://github.com/leberechtreinhold/tts-cloud-manager),
another tool which may interests you if you are on Windows and prefer a graphical user interface.

## Install

Build your own distribution from source or download the latest stable [release from GitHub](https://github.com/Chatanga/TTSCloudSync/releases).
Unzip the file for your operating system somewhere and run the scripts from there (or add the created directory to your `PATH`).

## How to build

Once you have installed the .NET 7.0 framework:

```bash
dotnet publish --os linux
dotnet publish --os win
```

Each call creates a corresponding ZIP file in `dist`.

## Commands

There are actually 4 command line tools provided for working with your TTS cloud and TTS mods you develop.

```bash
extract-ugc-url [--help] [SAVE] [> URL_LST]
```

Extract all the URLs for UGC (User-Generated Content) resources found in a JSON save (any kind of text file in fact).
Lua scripts are parsed along with the rest, but if the mod creates UGC URLs procedurally, the tool won't find them.

```bash
download-ugc-resources [--help] [--no-sha1] [-o OUTPUT_DIR] [FILE]
```

Download the UGC URLs from a file (or standard input) and store them in the provided output directory (or the current one).
Each resource ends up in a subdirectory named after the owner's Steam ID.
*Important: the Steam client must be running for this command to work.*

```bash
sync-with-cloud [--help] [--pull] [--dry-run] LOCAL_PATH [TTS_STEAM_CLOUD_PATH] [> MAPPING]
```

Synchronise your Steam cloud for Tabletop Simulator with a local path, adding, removing or moving resources to match the content of your local path.
When simply moved around, the shared URL of a resource remains the same.
*Important: the Steam client must be running for this command to work.*
Implicitly, all resources will be shared on your cloud and the tool will output the updated mapping:

```txt
file_name file_sha1 ugc_handle
```

The corresponding URL is `https://steamusercontent-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/<ugc_handle>/<file_sha1>/`
(formerly `http://cloud-3.steamusercontent.com/ugc/<ugc_handle>/<file_sha1>/`).

A TTS cloud enforces uniqueness of `(uppercase(file_name), file_sha1)` pairs and the tool will notify of any duplicate in your local path.
(The SHA1 is a checksum of the file content.)
It is important to understand that the directory structure in the TTS cloud is a pure TTS construct.
From the perspective of the underlying Steam cloud, there is only a flat list of files indexed by the pair mentionned above.
As such, you can have two different files (different SHA1 thus) named the same in the same location of your cloud (something you can't replicate locally),
but you cannot have the exact same file (same name and SHA1) in two different directories.

Additionally, when a file is uploaded into a TTS cloud, it is also shared under an arbitrary UGC URL.
Deleting then uploading the exact same file will generate a different UGC URL, resulting in broken links in foreign mod saves that you have no control over.
Simply moving a file using the TTS UI won't republish it hovewer, keeping its UGCÂ URL stable.

```bash
patch-ugc-url [--help] [-i] [--no-backup] MAPPING [SAVE]
```

Patch all UGC URLs in the provided save (or standard input) to use one from your cloud with the same SHA1 (whatever the name) if one exists.

## Workflow Example

Here is a typical worflow to rehost part or all of the resources of an existing mod save:

```bash
TTS_DIR="$HOME/.local/share/Tabletop Simulator"
mkdir resources

# 1. Download all the resources of a save.
extract-ugc-url "$TTS_DIR/Mods/Workshop/1234567890.json" | download-ugc-resources --no-sha1 -o resources

# 2. Tidy up and rearrange the content of the "resources" directory.
# You can very well choose to remove some resources you want to keep outside your cloud.

# 3. Push everything into your cloud (sync-with-cloud).
sync-with-cloud resources my_mod_name > mapping.lst

# 4. Patch the mod to use your own resources when available.
patch-ugc-url mapping.lst "$TTS_DIR/Mods/Workshop/1234567890.json" > "$TTS_DIR/Saves/TS_Save_100.json"
```

This way, you can easily relocate all the resources into your cloud to avoid any dead links in the future.

The previous example run on Linux, but the Windows version is almost the same:

```batch
set TTS_DIR=%UserProfile%\Documents\My Games\Tabletop Simulator
md resources

rem 1. Download all the resources of a save.
extract-ugc-url "%TTS_DIR%\Mods\Workshop\1234567890.json" | download-ugc-resources --no-sha1 -o resources

rem 2. Tidy up and rearrange the content of the "resources" directory.
rem You can very well choose to remove some resources you want to keep outside your cloud.

rem 3. Push everything into your cloud (sync-with-cloud).
sync-with-cloud resources my_mod_name > mapping.lst

rem 4. Patch the mod to use your own resources when available.
patch-ugc-url mapping.lst "%TTS_DIR%\Mods\Workshop\1234567890.json" > "%TTS_DIR%\Saves\TS_Save_100.json"
```
